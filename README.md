1.What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?


```sh
The implementation of the server part was really easy as it just involved a few 
changes to the script what we did in project 2
```

2.What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

```sh
The data retrieval part of AngularJS was a bit tricky as i couldnt properly 
understand how to access it. Once it was done then the animation part imposed 
some difficulty. 
```
3.If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?

Nothing would be,as these technologies are really cool to use.
